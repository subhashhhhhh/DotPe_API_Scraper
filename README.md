# DotPe Restaurant Data Extractor (Because Security is *Clearly* Their Forte)

**Feeling peckish but overwhelmed by the sheer number of options on those food delivery apps?**

Well, fret no more! Thanks to dotpe's unwavering commitment to data security (or lack thereof), I present this Python script â€“ a testament to their innovative approach to API protection.

**Features**

* **API Exploitation Made Easy:** Seamlessly navigates dotpe's publicly accessible API, showcasing their unparalleled dedication to keeping sensitive data... well, not so sensitive.
* **Error Handling for the Clueless:**  Gracefully handles missing data and unexpected responses, because apparently, consistency isn't a priority when you've raised hundreds of millions of dollars.
* **Anti-Scraping Measures? Please.** Effortlessly bypasses any non-existent anti-scraping measures, demonstrating dotpe's cutting-edge approach to... oh wait, there aren't any.
* **Proxy Support (For the Truly Paranoid):**  If you're worried about dotpe's crack team of cybersecurity experts tracking you down, feel free to use proxies. (Just kidding, they're probably too busy suing teenagers.)

**Disclaimer**

* This script is a satirical commentary on dotpe's security practices. Use it responsibly and at your own risk. I am not responsible for any legal action dotpe might take against you for accessing their publicly available API. (Seriously, they sued a teenager.)
* We strongly encourage dotpe to invest some of that venture capital in actual security measures instead of legal fees.

**Installation**

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/dotpe-restaurant-data-extractor.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install requests`
3. Configure the script (if you must): 
    * Set the `start_id`.
    * If you're *really* worried about getting caught, uncomment and configure the `proxies` dictionary.
4. Run the script and marvel at dotpe's cybersecurity prowess: `python your_script_name.py`

**Contributing**

Contributions are welcome, especially if they involve suggesting better security practices to dotpe. 

**License**

This project is licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE) - because even dotpe's API is more open-source than this.

**Happy Scraping! (And remember, don't mess with dotpe, they'll sue you faster than you can say "data breach.")**
